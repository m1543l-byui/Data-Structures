# Intro to Python Data Structures

Hello World, welcome to Python Data Structures. Every beginning Python programmer should understand these basic topics:

- [Stacks](1-Stack-Queue.md)
- [Sets](2-Sets-ll.md)
- [Trees](3-Trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
